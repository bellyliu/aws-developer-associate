# AWS Route53 Geoproximity
It allow us to redirect users traffic to our resources based on geographic location of the users and resources which potentialy reducing the latency and improvin users experience. It utilizing a `bias` value to adjust the geographic area from which traffic is routed to particular resources.

## Use cases
- Traffic Biasing:
Geoproximity routing allows for the allocation of traffic based on geographic location, with the option to shift traffic from one location to another using positive or negative bias values
- Latency Optimization:
By routing users to the nearest resource, applications experience reduced latency, leading to faster load times and a better overall user experience. 
- Data Residency Preferences:
Geoproximity routing can be used to route traffic to resources within specific geographic regions, fulfilling data residency requirements for sensitive data
### Example
1. US West (Oregon)
2. Europe (Frankfurt)
3. Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
4. Africa (Cape Town)
5. Middle East (Bahrain)

**Scenario 1:**

The following map shows what happens if you add a bias of +25 for the US West (Oregon) Region (number 1 on the map). Traffic is routed to the resource in that Region from a larger portion of North America and from all of South America than previously.

**Scenario 2:**

The following map shows what happens if you change the bias to -25 for the US West (Oregon) Region. Traffic is routed to the resource in that Region from smaller portions of North and South America than previously, and more traffic is routed to resources in the adjacent regions 2, 3, and 4.

# Summary
The effect of changing the bias for your resources depends on a number of factors, including the following:
The number of resources that you have.
How close the resources are to one another.
The number of users that you have near the border area between geographic regions. For example, suppose you have resources in the AWS Regions US East (N. Virginia) and US West (Oregon), and you have a lot of users in Dallas, Austin, and San Antonio, Texas, USA. Those cities are approximately equidistant between your resources, so a small change in bias could result in a large swing in traffic from resources in one AWS Region to another.
We recommend that you change the bias in small increments to prevent overwhelming your resources, due to an unanticipated swing in traffic.
